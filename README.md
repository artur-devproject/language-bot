## Lets Language

### Telegram Bot

**Active Bot:** [LetsGerman](https://t.me/LetsGermanBot)

**Tech stack:** JavaScript, NodeJS, Telegram API, MongoDB / Mongoose, DigitalOcean, Ubuntu 18.04

The bot is designed for people who are learning a foreign language. The main principle of the Bot is to send messages to the user with various sentences in their native language. The user, in turn, must send a response to the Bot with a translation in a foreign (studied) language. The bot checks the answer. If the answer is correct, the Bot sends a new task (message). if the answer is wrong, the Bot asks to try to answer again. If necessary, you can use the hint.

All tasks are divided into several sections according to difficulty levels. The messages from each section are in order. In addition, there is a function to switch to a random mode for sending messages.

The bot is based on the Telegram messenger. The bot is based on NodeJS. All tasks are stored in the MongoDB database.

The active bot is implemented for the German language on the Digital Ocean cloud server and launched in Telegram under the name @LetsGermanBot.
